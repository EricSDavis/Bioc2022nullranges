In support of reproducible research, data are tied to Ensembl releases and are kept separately from the software. Premade data packages are available for a variety of genomes and Ensembl releases. Three examples demonstrate typical use cases of this software.ensembldb is part of Bioconductor (https://bioconductor.org/packages/ensembldb).Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",
